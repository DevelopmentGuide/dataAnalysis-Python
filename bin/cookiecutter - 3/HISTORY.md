## 0.7.0 (2013-11-09)

This is a release with significant improvements and changes. Please read through this list before you upgrade.

New features:

* Support for \--checkout argument, thanks to [@foobacca](https://github.com/foobacca/).
* Support for pre-generate and post-generate hooks, thanks to [@raphigaziano](https://github.com/raphigaziano/). Hooks are Python or shell scripts that run before and/or after your project is generated.
* Support for absolute paths to cookiecutters, thanks to [@krallin](https://github.com/krallin/).
* Support for Mercurial version control system, thanks to [@pokoli](https://github.com/pokoli/).
* When a cookiecutter contains invalid Jinja2 syntax, you get a better message that shows the location of the TemplateSyntaxError. Thanks
to [@benjixx](https://github.com/benjixx/).
* Can now prompt the user to enter values during generation from a local cookiecutter, thanks to [@ThomasChiroux](https://github.com/ThomasChiroux/). This is now always the default behavior. Prompts can also be suppressed with ```--no-input```.
* Your cloned cookiecutters are stored by default in your ~/.cookiecutters/ directory (or Windows equivalent). The location is configurable. (This is a major change from the pre-0.7.0 behavior, where cloned cookiecutters were deleted at the end of project generation.) Thanks [@raphigaziano](https://github.com/raphigaziano/).
* User config in a \~/.cookiecutterrc file, thanks to [@raphigaziano](https://github.com/raphigaziano/). Configurable settings are cookiecutters\_dir and default\_context.
* File permissions are now preserved during project generation, thanks to [@benjixx](https://github.com/benjixx/).

Bug fixes:

* Unicode issues with prompts and answers are fixed, thanks to [@s-m-i-t-a](https://github.com/s-m-i-t-a/).
* The test suite now runs on Windows, which was a major effort. Thanks to [@pydanny](https://github.com/pydanny), who collaborated on this with me.

Other changes:

* Quite a bit of refactoring and API changes.
* Lots of documentation improvements. Thanks [@sloria](https://github.com/sloria/), [@alex](https://github.com/alex/), [@pydanny](https://github.com/pydanny), [@freakboy3742](https://github.com/freakboy3742), [@es128](https://github.com/es128/), [@rolo](https://github.com/rolo/).
* Better naming and organization of test suite.
* A CookiecutterCleanSystemTestCase to use for unit tests affected by the user\'s config and cookiecutters directory.
* Improvements to the project\'s Makefile.
* Improvements to tests. Thanks [@gperetin](https://github.com/gperetin/), [@s-m-i-t-a](https://github.com/s-m-i-t-a/).
* Removal of subprocess32 dependency. Now using non-context manager version of subprocess.Popen for Python 2 compatibility.
* Removal of cookiecutter\'s cleanup module.
* A bit of setup.py cleanup, thanks to [@oubiga](https://github.com/oubiga/).
* Now depends on binaryornot 0.2.0.

* Fix TemplateNotFound Exception on Windows (#37).

## 0.6.3 (2013-08-20)

## 0.6.2 (2013-08-19)

* Depend on Jinja2\>=2.4 instead of Jinja2==2.7.
* Fix errors on attempt to render binary files. Copy them over from the project template without rendering.
* Fix Python 2.6/2.7 UnicodeDecodeError when values containing Unicode chars are in cookiecutter.json.
* Set encoding in Python 3 unicode_open() to always be utf-8.

## 0.6.1 (2013-08-12)

* Improved project template finding. Now looks for the occurrence of {{,cookiecutter, and }} in a directory name.
* Fix help message for input_dir arg at command prompt.
* Minor edge cases found and corrected, as a result of improved test coverage.

## 0.6.0 (2013-08-08)

* Config is now in a single ```cookiecutter.json``` instead of in ```json/```.
* When you create a project from a git repo template, Cookiecutter prompts you to enter custom values for the fields defined in ```cookiecutter.json```.

## 0.5 (2013-07-28)

* Friendlier, more simplified command line usage:

```bash
    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage/ template
    $ cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypackage/
    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template
    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage.git
```  

* Can now use Cookiecutter from Python as a package:

```python
    from cookiecutter.main import cookiecutter

    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage/ template
    cookiecutter('cookiecutter-pypackage/')

    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template
    cookiecutter('https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage.git')
```

* Internal refactor to remove any code that changes the working
    directory.

## 0.4 (2013-07-22)

* Only takes in one argument now: the input directory. The output directory is generated by rendering the name of the input directory.
* Output directory cannot be the same as input directory.

## 0.3 (2013-07-17)

* Takes in command line args for the input and output directories.

## 0.2.1 (2013-07-17)

* Minor cleanup.

## 0.2 (2013-07-17)

Bumped to "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha".

* Works with any type of text file.
* Directory names and filenames can be templated.

## 0.1.0 (2013-07-11)

* First release on PyPI.
